# freebsd-10.1-minimal
Simple, minimal mirror of FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.

First in a series of minimal, binary only re-distributions
of various free UNIX-like operating systems.

Intended for use in package managers, building chroots, jails,
containers, and VM bootstrapping.

Right now, this is simply an unpacking of base.txz, kernel.txz,
and lib32.txz from ftp.freebsd.org.
